"""
This example uses the TensorFlow tf.keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer class to create a vocabulary of all the unique subwords in the training data. The vocabulary is then used to tokenize a sentence. The output of the tokenizer is a list of tokens, where each token is a word or a subword.

Here is a more detailed explanation of how the tokenizer works:

The Tokenizer class is initialized with a parameter num_words. This parameter specifies the maximum number of words to include in the vocabulary. If num_words is None, then all the unique words in the training data will be included in the vocabulary.
The fit_on_texts method is used to fit the tokenizer to a corpus of text. This method takes a list of strings as input and outputs the tokenizer.
The texts_to_sequences method is used to tokenize a list of strings. This method takes a list of strings as input and outputs a list of lists of integers. Each inner list represents the tokens of a single string.
